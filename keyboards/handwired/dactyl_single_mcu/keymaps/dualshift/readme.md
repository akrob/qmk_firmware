# DUALSHIFT keymap that I use for my Iris and Dactyl
Just the right amount of work get's done with the thumbs.
First attempt at trying mods on home row didn't go as I thought it would. Shift on home row middle finger seemed suprisingly taxing. My whole hand was getting tired, athough it really worked pretty well getting the timing of the timeout per keys dialed in. Moving the mods back down to bottom row cause it felt comfortable there and the times it interfered with stuff was less often. 

`pushd ~/git/qmk_firmware ; make handwired/dactyl_single_mcu:dualshift CTPC=yes ; popd`

#### Note
I run exclusivily on thinkpads. As such I have flipped home/end with pageup/dn in low level of the OS's on each of my machines. So I have them flipped as well in this mapping.
## This is no longer true, I run on a mac now for work... will need to solve this better, but for now I am going to revert this so home/end page up/down are correct.
