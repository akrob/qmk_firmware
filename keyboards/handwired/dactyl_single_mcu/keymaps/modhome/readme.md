# MODHOME keymap that I use for my Iris and Dactyl
Just the right amount of work get's done with the thumbs.
First attempt at trying mods on home row
`pushd ~/git/qmk_firmware ; make handwired/dactyl_single_mcu:modhome CTPC=yes ; popd`

#### Note
I run exclusivily on thinkpads. As such I have flipped home/end with pageup/dn in low level of the OS's on each of my machines. So I have them flipped as well in this mapping.
