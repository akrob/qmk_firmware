# ModHOME keymap that I use for my Iris and Dactyl
Just the right amount of work get's done with the thumbs.
First attempt at using home row mods. 

`pushd ~/git/qmk_firmware ; make keebio/iris/rev2:modhome ; popd`

#### Note
I run exclusivily on thinkpads. As such I have flipped home/end with pageup/dn in low level of the OS's on each of my machines. So I have them flipped as well in this mapping.
