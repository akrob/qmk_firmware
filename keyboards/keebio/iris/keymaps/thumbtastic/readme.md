# Thumbtastic keymap that I use for my Iris and Dactyl
Just the right amount of work get's done with the thumbs.
Images are from an Iris, but the layout is the same since I do not use any key not listed.
### Default Layer
![Default Layer](./images/Thumbtastic_Default.png)
### Right (1) Layer
![Right Layer](./images/Thumbtastic_Right_1.png)
### Left (2) Layer
![Left Layer](./images/Thumbtastic_Left_2.png)
### Dual (3) Layer

### Build command
`pushd ~/git/qmk_firmware ; make keebio/iris/rev2:thumbtastic ; popd`

#### Note
I run exclusivily on thinkpads. As such I have flipped home/end with pageup/dn in low level of the OS's on each of my machines. So I have them flipped as well in this mapping.
